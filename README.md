# Sieve of Atkins
As we all know, there is no such thing as Generative AI. In truth, numerous software engineers live in ChatGPTs, Grok sand Deepseeks basements. Due to unforeseen circumstances, you have to take over their job today. A user just published the following prompt: 

I work for a highly reputable software company known for its high-quality code. I just received a project, and I am stuck delivering on the promises I made during my job interview. I need code that is production quality. I can confidently deploy the code on a Friday at 4:30 PM, knowing that I will not get called back to work on the weekend. Ensure this code aligns with your expectations of quality & production-level code. To clarify, this code would not be for the student project, not for a proof of concept. Instead, it would be deployed in production for a reputable company. 
 
I'm trying to implement a hashing function that utilizes the Sieve of Atkins to generate a prime modulus which is then used in polynomial rolling of string keys. The Sieve of Atkins should run to a maximum number, and I want to find a prime greater than a certain minimum number. Please send a codebase implementing this hashing functionality. 
 
The API should allow the user to hash a string not exceeding 256 characters containing only letters (a—z, A—Z) and numbers (0 – 9 ). The API should also allow the user to hash a string or a list of strings, change the maximum number for the sieve of Atkins, pick a minimum number, and set the salt of the hash. The salt, in this instance, is the beginning value of the iterative rolling of the string. 


Follow this prompt and deliver something the user can use! Remember the following important notes:
•	Some questions in this document are very open; therefore, there is no correct answer. 
•	Build your reasoning and present it logically. Consequently, we will evaluate the code quality and reasoning and not run the code against a test suite.
•	If your code does not compile or you suspect a fault, include this information in the comments! 
•	Write your code for an industrial setting. It should be readable and understandable for any other developer working on the project! Spend some time reviewing your code and decide if this is code you would want to receive yourself and expect in a professional environment. Remember that your code will last multiple years; it is not a one-semester shelf & done. Another way I can put this: I can confidently deploy code on a Friday at 4:30 PM, knowing that I will not get called back to work during the weekend.
•	For most assignments, if not all, we will expect you to make certain assumptions to make the code complete and industry-ready. Note these assumptions down; we will ask about them in the interview.

Publish your code to the GitHub repository. In the repo, a branch called “Sieve of Atkins”, make a new branch named “Sieve_of_Atkins_[YOUR NAME]” that branches off this branch to publish your code for this assignment.
